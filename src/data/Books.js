        "It is rightly said that habits make or break a man. \
      If you want to know why you are not doing something right, \
      sometimes all you need is to perform an analysis of your habits and consider altering them. \
      Because sometimes it’s not about what you do, but more about how you do it! And that’s where your habits play a very important role."
